## Yes, I now have a linux computer

This repo contains files from my home directory needed for operation of my
operating system, as well as my scripts that I use on the daily basis.


### Suckless software 
I use *flexipatch* for all of it, since I'm a shameful normie.

My builds of:
* dwm
* dmenu
* st
* slock
